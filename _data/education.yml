  title: MSc. in Computer Science (2 years)
  description: And here I found my path. I discovered Computer Graphics and fell in love with it and it's cousin 'Computational Geometry'.<br>
               I deepened my knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and low-level programming, and I started to understand the complexity of real-time systems.<br><br>
               I also had the chance to work on a research project about real-time visibility computation in 3D scenes, which made me understand the potential of these techniques.
               The thesis was a challenging but rewarding experience that taught me a lot about problem-solving and perseverance.

  title: BSc. in Computer Science (3 years)
  description: This is where I built my foundational knowledge and realised there was more to computing than just typing.<br>Maths. Lots of Maths.<br><br>
              I particularly enjoyed Algorithms and Compilers courses, which made me take a look at the deep beauty of computer science.
              Lots of inputs and possibilities, but I was still searching for my path.

  description: Where I finally fell in love with sciences. And when I started my long journey of self discovery.<br>
                It wasn't the easiest path, in our last year we were only nine students ("the excellence", they said), but in hindsight it gave me and headstart over the university years.<br>
                Moreover, I now recognize that my curiosity and critical thinking were born there, mostly during philosophy classes.
  thesis: "The communication during the 20th century"
  grades: 86/100
  period: 2006-2011
