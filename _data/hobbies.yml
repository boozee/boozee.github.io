- title: Economy
  blurb: From studying about the shenanigans of macroeconomics to following the latest news, I find economics fascinating.
        I also enjoy discussing it with friends and family, even if they don't always share my enthusiasm.
        I'm an active practitioner of personal finance, not to become rich, but for the fun I find in such a practical science.

        Part-time avid reader, I love to the chrime novels challenge but among my favourites there are all kind of books, from science fiction to philosophy.
        Two unrequested recommendations: "The Foundation" by I. Asimov and "Crime and Punishment" by F. Dostoevskij.

  blurb: When a boy it was my greatest passion, I still remember my first console, a Game Boy Advance with the completely random Dungeons&Dragons game.
        Now I play less, although I'm particularly fascinated by simulations and city-builders.
